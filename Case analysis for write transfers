### **Case Analysis: Write Transfers in AMBA APB Protocol**

#### **1. Setup Phase (First Clock Cycle)**
- The master asserts `PSEL` to indicate a valid transaction.
- The `PWRITE` signal is set **high** to indicate a write transfer.
- A valid address is placed on `PADDR`.
- `PWDATA` is set to the data to be written.
- `PENABLE` remains **low**.
- `PSLVERR` is not asserted.

#### **2. Access Phase (Second Clock Cycle)**
- The master maintains `PSEL`, `PWRITE`, and `PADDR` values.
- `PENABLE` is asserted **high**.
- The slave sets `PREADY` **high** once it is ready to accept data.
- If `PREADY` is **low**, the master remains in the access phase until `PREADY` is **high**.
- The data on `PWDATA` is written to the corresponding memory location.
- If an invalid address is detected, `PSLVERR` is asserted.

#### **3. Transfer Completion**
- The master deasserts `PSEL` and `PENABLE` after receiving acknowledgment (`PREADY` high).
- If `PSLVERR` is asserted, the master may trigger an error handling routine.

#### **4. Error Handling Cases**
- **Invalid Address:** If `PADDR` is out of the valid range, `PSLVERR` is set **high**, and the transfer is not completed.
- **Write Failure:** If the peripheral does not acknowledge the write request, `PREADY` remains **low**, leading to a stalled transaction.

#### **5. Timing Considerations**
- The number of wait states should **not exceed the number of cycles PREADY is deasserted**.
- The master must **not change address or control signals** during the access phase.
- Once `PREADY` is asserted, the write transfer **must be completed within the same cycle**.

#### **6. Edge Cases**
- **Repeated Write Requests:** If the same address is written multiple times, the latest value should overwrite the previous one.
- **Back-to-Back Transfers:** If a new write request follows immediately, `PSEL` can be reasserted without deasserting it between cycles.
- **Slave Delays:** If a slow peripheral takes multiple cycles to assert `PREADY`, the master must wait appropriately.

This case analysis ensures correct implementation of AMBA APB write transfers and accounts for various edge cases that may arise in real-world scenarios.
